# Family Expense
1. **Anything that uses ACH**
	MUST Discuss and record in the shared document, including 
	- Purpose
	- Which account
	- Expected amount, frequency
	- duration
	**Avoid this payment type as much as possible.**
2. Anything that uses a Credit Card
	Expenses such as
	- Groceries
	- Fuel Purchase
	- Anything that's for the family (Needs prior communication and approval)
	Will be using a credit card from the other person. 
	Once the monthly statement is formed, 
	1.  Total all the authorized card transactions balances
	2.  Each person is responsible for half of the transaction unless the transaction is unfair and unreasonable (In that case, the individual is not responsible for that transaction)
	3. Each person pays a difference to the other person
