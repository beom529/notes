Server s1 proposed P 3.1 with value X, and succeeds over quorum (s1, s2, s3.) Now, server s5 makes the proposal P 4.5 with value Y and the new quorum for this proposal is servers, s5, s4, and s3.

Question: What proposals succeed and why?

Server s1 proposed P 3.1 with value X, and it has not succeeded yet over quorum (s1, s2, s3.)

 Server s5 makes the proposal P 4.5 with value Y and the new quorum for this proposal is servers, s5, s4, and s3.


Question: What proposals succeed and why?

Scenario: Server s1 proposed P 3.1 with value X, and it has not succeeded yet over quorum (s1, s2, s3.) Server s5 makes the proposal P 4.5 with value Y and the new quorum for this proposal is servers, s5, s4, and s3.

Consider the logs in a cluster of 5 servers (the contents of the entries are not shown). Which log entries may safely be applied to state machines? Explain your answer.

Each follower stores 3 pieces of information on its disk: its current term, its most recent vote, and all of the log entries it has accepted. =

Suppose that the follower crashes, and when it restarts, its most recent vote has been lost.

Question: Is it safe for the follower to rejoin the cluster (assuming no modifications to the algorithm)? Explain your answer.

1. PREPARE P3.1X이 S1,S2,S3에 갔어
2. ACCEPT P3.1X이 S1으로가 
3. PREPARE P4.5Y가 S3,S4,S5로 가
4. ACCEPT P3.1X이 S2으로가 

질분은 다음과 같아 "What proposals succeed and why?"

그리고 내가 "Lastly, the questions ask, ‘What proposals succeed and why?’ I am wondering if the definition of a successful proposal refers to ‘the acceptance of the proposal regardless of the chosen value’ or ‘the acceptance of the proposal with the proposed value." 라고 교수한테 물어봤더니 교수가 "succeed refers to all members of the quorum finishing the protocol Note that they can not succeed on different values, that will mean that the algorithm is incorrect" 라고 말해
