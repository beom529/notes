Multi Paxos

Server s1 proposed P 3.1 with value X, and succeeds over quorum (s1, s2, s3.) Now, server s5 makes the proposal P 4.5 with value Y and the new quorum for this proposal is servers, s5, s4, and s3.

Question: What proposals succeed and why?

}More robust that process groups approach

}Safety does not require synchronous communication

}Liveness requires that we are able to detect failures within a certain timeout

}Requires a stable-enough network to elect a leader that will stay stable for a while

}Requires a (potentially changing) majority of members to support the leader (in order to make progress)
