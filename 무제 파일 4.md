Server s1 proposed P 3.1 with value X, and succeeds over quorum (s1, s2, s3.) Now, server s5 makes the proposal P 4.5 with value Y and the new quorum for this proposal is servers, s5, s4, and s3.

}Provides a solution to consensus (agreement) in an asynchronous model

}Safety 

}Only a value that has been proposed may be chosen

}Only a single value is chosen

}A node never learns that a value has been chosen unless it actually has been

}Liveness (as long as majority of servers up and communicating with reasonable timeliness)

}Some proposed value is eventually chosen

}If a value has been chosen, a node can eventually learn the value 이거 설명해줘
